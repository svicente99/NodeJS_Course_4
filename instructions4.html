<p>In this assignment, you will be extending the router to support
the ability to save and retrieve a list of favorite dishes by each of
the registered users. All registered users in the system should have
the ability to save any dish as their favorite dish, retrieve all
their favorite dishes and remove one or all their favorite dishes.</p>

	<p><strong>Assignment Requirements</strong></p>
	<p>In this assignment, you will be supporting a new route
	<a href="https://localhost:3443/favorites," target="_blank">https://localhost:3443/favorites,</a>
	where the users can do a GET to retrieve all their favorite dishes,
	a POST to add a list of dishes to their favorites, and a DELETE to
	delete the list of their favorites. In addition, you will support
	the new route <a href="https://localhost:3443/favorites/:dishId" target="_blank">https://localhost:3443/favorites/:dishId</a>
	where the users can issue a POST request to add the dish to their
	list of favorite dishes, and a DELETE request to delete the specific
	dish from the list of their favorite dishes.</p>
	<p>This assignment consists of the following three tasks:</p>
	<p><strong>Task 1</strong></p>
	<p>In this task you will be implementing a new Mongoose schema named
	<em>favoriteSchema</em>, and a model named <em>Favorites</em> in the
	file named f<em>avorite.js</em> in the <em>models</em> folder. This
	schema should take advantage of the mongoose population support to
	populate the information about the user and the list of dishes when
	the user does a GET operation. <span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt;
	OK √</span><code class="western"> </code>
	</p>
	<p><strong>Task 2</strong></p>
	<p>In this task, you will implement the Express router() for the
	'/favorites' URI such that you support GET, POST and DELETE
	operations</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the user does a GET
		operation on '/favorites', you will populate the user information
		and the dishes information before returning the favorites to the
		user. <span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt; OK √</span></p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the user does a POST
		operation on '/favorites' by including [{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;dish
		ObjectId&quot;}, . . ., {&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;dish ObjectId&quot;}]
		in the body of the message, you will (a) create a favorite document
		if such a document corresponding to this user does not already
		exist in the system,<span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt; OK
		√</span><br/>
(b) add the dishes specified in the body of the
		message to the list of favorite dishes for the user, if the dishes
		do not already exists in the list of favorites. <span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt;
		OK √</span></p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the user performs a DELETE
		operation on '/favorites', you will delete the list of favorites
		corresponding to the user, by deleting the favorite document
		corresponding to this user from the collection. <span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt;
		OK √</span></p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the user performs a POST
		operation on '/favorites/:dishId', then you will add the specified
		dish to the list of the user's list of favorite dishes, if the dish
		is not already in the list of favorite dishes. <span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt;
		OK √</span></p>
		<li/>
<p>When the user performs a DELETE operation on
		'/favorites/:dishId', then you will remove the specified dish from
		the list of the user's list of favorite dishes. <span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt;
		OK √</span></p>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Task 3</strong></p>
	<p>You will update app.js to support the new '/favorites' route. 
	<span style="background: #ffff00">===&gt; OK √</span></p>

	<p>Your assignment will be graded on the basis of the following
	review criteria:</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A new favoriteSchema and
		Favorites model has been correctly implemented to take advantage of
		Mongoose Population support to track the users and the list of
		favorite dishes using their ObjectIds in the favoriteSchema and
		Favorites model.</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The GET, POST and DELETE
		operations are well supported as per the specifications above</p>
		<li/>
<p>The app.js has been updated to support the new route.</p>
